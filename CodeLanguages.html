  <h2 id="#html">Html</h2>
  <div>
    <p>HTML is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and compose text, images, and other material into visible or audible web pages.
       Default characteristics for every item of HTML markup are defined in the browser, and these characteristics can be altered or enhanced 
       by the web page designer's additional use of CSS. Many of the text elements are mentioned in the 1988 ISO technical report TR 9537 
       Techniques for using SGML, which describes the features of early text formatting languages such as that used by the RUNOFF command 
       developed in the early 1960s for the CTSS (Compatible Time-Sharing System) operating system. These formatting commands were derived 
       from the commands used by typesetters to manually format documents. However, the SGML concept of generalized markup is based on elements 
       (nested annotated ranges with attributes) rather than merely print effects, with separate structure and markup. 
       HTML has been progressively moved in this direction with CSS.</p>
  </div>
  <h2>Css</h2>
  <div>
    <p>CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, 
      and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility, since the content can be written without concern for its presentation; 
      provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; 
      enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a 
      separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable 
      the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.</p>
  </div>
  <h2>C</h2>
  <div>
    <p>C is an imperative procedural language, supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, with a static type system. 
      It was designed to be compiled to provide low-level access to memory and language constructs that map efficiently to machine instructions,
      all with minimal runtime support. Despite its low-level capabilities, the language was designed to encourage cross-platform programming. 
      A standards-compliant C program written with portability in mind can be compiled for a wide variety of computer platforms and 
      operating systems with few changes to its source code.</p>
  </div>
  <h2>PHP</h2>
  <div>
<p>PHP is a general-purpose scripting language geared towards web development.It was originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer 
    Rasmus Lerdorf in 1993 and released in 1995. The PHP reference implementation is now produced by the PHP Group.
    PHP was originally an abbreviation of Personal Home Page, but it now stands for the recursive acronym PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.</p>

  <p>PHP code is usually processed on a web server by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module, a daemon or a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) 
    executable. On a web server, the result of the interpreted and executed PHP code—which may be any type of data, such as generated HTML or 
    binary image data—would form the whole or part of an HTTP response. Various web template systems, web content management systems, 
    and web frameworks exist that can be employed to orchestrate or facilitate the generation of that response. 
    Additionally, PHP can be used for many programming tasks outside the web context, such as standalone graphical applications and drone control.
    PHP code can also be directly executed from the command line.</p>>
  
  <p>The standard PHP interpreter, powered by the Zend Engine, is free software released under the PHP License. 
    PHP has been widely ported and can be deployed on most web servers on a variety of operating systems and platforms.
    The PHP language has evolved without a written formal specification or standard, 
    with the original implementation acting as the de facto standard that other implementations aimed to follow.</p>
    </div>
  <h2>SQL</h2>
  <div>
    <p>Structured Query Language (SQL) (pronounced S-Q-L; less commonly "sequel")is a domain-specific language used to manage data, 
      especially in a relational database management system (RDBMS). It is particularly useful in handling structured data, i.e., 
      data incorporating relations among entities and variables.</p>

      <p>Introduced in the 1970s, SQL offered two main advantages over older read–write APIs such as ISAM or VSAM. Firstly, 
      it introduced the concept of accessing many records with one single command. Secondly, it eliminates the need to specify how to reach a record, i.e., with or without an index.
      
      <p>Originally based upon relational algebra and tuple relational calculus, SQL consists of many types of statements,
       which may be informally classed as sublanguages, commonly: Data query Language (DQL), Data Definition Language (DDL), 
       Data Control Language (DCL), and Data Manipulation Language (DML).</p>
      
      <p>The scope of SQL includes data query, data manipulation (insert, update, and delete), data definition (schema creation and modification),
        and data access control. Although SQL is essentially a declarative language (4GL), it also includes procedural elements.</p>
      
      <p>SQL was one of the first commercial languages to use Edgar F. Codd's relational model. The model was described in his influential 1970 paper,
        "A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks". Despite not entirely adhering to the relational model as described by Codd, SQL
         became the most widely used database language.</p>
      
      <p>SQL became a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986 and of the International Organization for Standardization 
      (ISO) in 1987. Since then, the standard has been revised multiple times to include a larger set of features and incorporate common 
      extensions. Despite the existence of standards, virtually no implementations in existence adhere to it fully, 
      and most SQL code requires at least some changes before being ported to different database systems.</p>
  </div>
  <h2>Java</h2>
  <div>
<p>Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. 
   It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA),
   meaning that compiled Java code can run 
   on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile.[17] Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run
   on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. 
   The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic 
  capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages.</p>
  </div>
  <h2>JavaScript</h2>
  <div>
    <p>JavaScript often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language and core technology of the Web, 
      alongside HTML and CSS. 99% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior.
      Web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine that executes the client code. These engines are also utilized in some servers and
      a variety of apps. The most popular runtime system for non-browser usage is Node.js.
      JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard. It has dynamic typing, 
      prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative 
      programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data 
      structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
      The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, 
      the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.
      Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ 
      greatly in design.</p>
